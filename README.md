TASK 1:
This code implements a simple rule-based chatbot in Python. The chatbot responds to user input based on predefined patterns using regular expressions. It covers various topics such as greetings, jokes, information about itself, and more. The program continues running until the user inputs an exit command (e.g., "exit" or "bye"). The chatbot provides responses according to the matched patterns or a default response if no patterns are found.

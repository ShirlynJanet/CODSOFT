TASK 1:
This code implements a simple rule-based chatbot in Python. The chatbot responds to user input based on predefined patterns using regular expressions. It covers various topics such as greetings, jokes, information about itself, and more. The program continues running until the user inputs an exit command (e.g., "exit" or "bye"). The chatbot provides responses according to the matched patterns or a default response if no patterns are found.

TASK 2:
This Python program is an interactive console-based implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe. It offers two gameplay modes: playing against a computer opponent and playing against another human player. The game board is represented as a 3x3 matrix, and players take turns making moves until there is a winner or a tie. This program offers an engaging and interactive experience for playing Tic-Tac-Toe. It provides flexibility for players to compete against an intelligent computer opponent or challenge a friend in a two-player mode. The addition of a feedback option enhances the user experience.

Features:

1. Against the Computer (AI):
The computer utilizes the minimax algorithm to make strategic moves.
Player provides their name at the beginning.
The game displays the board after each move.
Announces the winner or a tie when the game concludes.

2. Against Another Player:
Two players take turns making moves.
Players enter their names at the start.
The game displays the board after each move.
Declares the winner or a tie when the game ends.

3. Exit:
Exiting the game is initiated by choosing option 3.
Users are prompted to provide feedback before the program terminates.

Throughout the game, the program guides the user through making moves, handles invalid inputs, and provides a clear display of the game state
